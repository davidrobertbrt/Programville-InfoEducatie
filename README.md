# Programville-InfoEducatie

Prize mention at "InfoEducatie" 2020 Contest

# Description
Making a quiz application for testing knowledge in various fields gives the user the opportunity to expand his knowledge and improve himself in the field that he activates. The application can be used by schools to companies that want to increase the performance of their employees. Each test can be customized by an administrator account and uploaded for solving. The statistics, available to both administrators and users, provide in-depth knowledge that needs to be deepened.
This project was made for educational purposes. The program contains, at the time of creation, the possibility to create and edit tests, to organize them according to subjects. Based on the solutions made by the users, statistics are built both for each user and for everyone else. Each test is presented in the form of an information card, where the user can see both the description and the presentation image. Thus, the interface becomes friendly and captures the user's attention.
